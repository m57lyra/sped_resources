My <daughter/son>, <NAME>, is currently attending <SCHOOL NAME>, 
in the <#> grade. <He/She> She is currently on a 504 accommodation plan that was to be 
reviewed by <SOME DATE>.  <CHILD> has been diagnosed with <LIST>. 
In <MONTH>, I was notified by the teacher that <CHILD> was having significant 
academic difficulties in the classroom and that the teacher felt that <he/she> 
was “falling through the cracks”. We are working with <his/her> medical team to ensure 
that <CHILD>’s neurological stability is maintained.  

In spite of the 504 accommodations and modifications, <CHILD> is still 
experiencing significant distress and daily struggles within the classroom.  It was my 
intent to bring this up at our 504 update meeting, however, as the date for reassessment 
of the 504 plan has passed, I feel it is necessary to put my request in writing at this time. 

This letter is intended to formally request for a multifactored evaluation as defined under 
IDEA regulations to assess the specific educational and related service needs that <CHILD> 
may have subsequent to <his/her> multiple diagnoses. It is imperative that <he/she> is 
evaluated in all 8 domains and that testing is complete and comprehensive enough to ensure 
that <his/her> academic and social needs are addressed within the assessment. 

I look forward to working with the IEP team to identify and implement appropriate supports 
that will ensure that <CHILD> receives a free and appropriate public education. I 
understand a meeting will be scheduled within the next 10 days for us to develop an 
evaluation plan as well as sign the permissions for assessment. Please keep in mind 
when scheduling any meetings that I have retained an educational consultant who will 
need to be teleconferenced in.


Sincerely,


<YOUR NAME>
